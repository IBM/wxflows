# RAG Example | IBM watsonx.ai flows engine

## Run the application in the browser

You can run this application in the browser using the free service StackBlitz:

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/IBM/wxflows/tree/main/examples/rag-question-answer/app)

In the `.env` file add the values generated by the following command:

```bash
   echo VITE_WXFLOWS_ENDPOINT=https://$(wxflows whoami --account).$(wxflows whoami --domain)/wxflows-genai/watsonxdocs/graphql 
   echo VITE_WXFLOWS_APIKEY=$(wxflows whoami --apikey)
```

You need to be logged into the `wxflows` CLI to generate the above values!

## Run the application locally

### Prerequisites

- Follow the instructions to set up a RAG flow

### Installation

You need to have Node.js (>16) installed on your machine, from this directory run:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the needed dependencies for the project.

Add your environment variables for watsonx.ai flows engine to a new `.env` file, you need to be logged into the `wxflows` CLI, by running:

```bash
   echo VITE_WXFLOWS_ENDPOINT=https://$(wxflows whoami --account).$(wxflows whoami --domain)/wxflows-genai/watsonxdocs/graphql >> .env
   echo VITE_WXFLOWS_APIKEY=$(wxflows whoami --apikey) >> .env
```

### Getting started

You can now start the application by running:

```
npm run dev
```

The location of the application will be shown in your terminal. 

Make sure the `flowName` and `collection` variables on line 11 in `/src/callWxflows.js` match your values in `wxflows.toml`.
